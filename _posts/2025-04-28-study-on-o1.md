## Introduction

Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as transformative tools in artificial intelligence, revolutionizing tasks such as natural language processing, machine translation, and conversational AI. Their unprecedented capabilities in understanding, generating, and interacting with human language have significantly advanced diverse domains, including healthcare, education, entertainment, and scientific research. These capabilities stem from the models’ ability to process massive amounts of data while leveraging sophisticated training paradigms to capture linguistic nuances and semantic relationships.

This remarkable success is rooted in a structured development process comprising three interconnected stages: preprocessing, pre-training, and post-training. Each stage contributes to the model's overall capability and adaptability, as illustrated in the following figure:

{% include figure.html path="assets/img/2025-04-28-study-on-o1/comparison.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}

* **Preprocessing** lays the groundwork by preparing high-quality input data. Techniques such as tokenization and filtering ensure data uniformity, while regularization and encoder-decoder architectures enhance robustness for subsequent training stages.
* **Pre-training** develops general language knowledge using large, unlabeled datasets. Models like BERT and GPT employ methods such as masked language modeling (MLM) and unsupervised learning to capture linguistic patterns, enabling broad generalization across tasks.
* **Post-training** adapts the model to specific applications or domains through advanced techniques, including reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF), supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and direct preference optimization (DPO). These methods refine the general knowledge gained during pre-training, enhancing task-specific performance, precision, and applicability.

Despite their transformative potential, LLMs face several pressing challenges. One key issue is the **scarcity of high-quality training data**, which limits scalability. While synthetic data generation offers potential solutions, it introduces risks concerning alignment and quality maintenance. Additionally, ensuring **safety and reliability** poses significant hurdles. For instance, advanced reasoning techniques such as Chain of Thought (CoT) can inadvertently lead to unintended behaviors like reward hacking or exploitation of system vulnerabilities. These challenges necessitate innovative methodologies to ensure sustainable advancements in LLM development. OpenAI-o1 serves as a pioneering approach, addressing these issues through novel techniques aimed at enhancing alignment, safety, and robustness.

## Key Techniques of LLMs

This section provides an overview of key techniques used in pre-training and post-training to improve model performance, adaptability, and application scope. These techniques include basic methods, such as data preparation and fine-tuning, as well as advanced approaches for alignment, domain adaptation, and multimodal capability enhancement. As shown in the follow figure, these methods work together to optimize the model's functionality and scalability, ensuring its effectiveness across diverse tasks.

{% include figure.html path="assets/img/2025-04-28-study-on-o1/Techniques.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}

### Key Techniques of Pre-training

Pre-training is the initial phase of training a model on large-scale datasets, enabling it to learn generalizable features and foundational knowledge. For instance, in natural language processing (NLP), pre-trained models like BERT and GPT are trained on extensive text corpora to capture universal language patterns that form the basis for understanding and generating text. 

The primary objective of pre-training is to develop a robust feature extractor, which can then be fine-tuned for specific downstream tasks. To achieve this, the pre-training phase employs several key techniques designed to optimize learning and enhance generalization.

 **1)  Self-supervised Learning.** In self-supervised learning `<d-cite key="Gui2023ASO"></d-cite>`, tasks are divided into two main types: pretext tasks and downstream tasks. Pretext tasks involve training an AI system to uncover meaningful representations from unstructured data. These representations can then serve as input for downstream tasks, such as supervised learning or reinforcement learning.

- **Pretext Tasks** are self-supervised learning tasks designed to create surrogate labels from unlabeled data, enabling the model to learn generalizable representations.

$$
\mathcal{L}_{\text{pretext}} = \mathbb{E}_{x \sim \mathcal{D}} \left[ \ell\left( f_\theta(T(x)), g_\phi(h(T'(x))) \right) \right]
$$


> $x$: Unlabeled data sample.
>
> $T(x), T'(x)$: Augmented views of $x$.
>
> $f_\theta, g_\phi$: Encoder and projection head for representation learning.
>
> $\mathcal{D}$: Dataset distribution.

- **Downstream tasks** use representations learned from pretext tasks to solve domain-specific supervised or unsupervised problems.

  $$
  \mathcal{L}_{\text{downstream}} = \mathbb{E}_{(x, y) \sim \mathcal{D}'} \left[ \ell\left( h_\psi(f_\theta(x)), y \right) \right]
  $$

> $(x, y)$: Input-output pair from labeled downstream dataset $\mathcal{D}'$.
>
> $f_\theta$: Encoder from pretext task.
>
> $h_\psi$: Task-specific head.
>
> $\ell$: Loss function for the specific downstream task.

 **2) Transformer Architecture.** The Transformer `<d-cite key="Vaswani2017AttentionIA"></d-cite>` is a neural network architecture designed for sequence modeling and transformation, with its core idea being the attention mechanism, completely removing the constraints of traditional RNNs and CNNs. By combining Multi-Head Self-Attention and Feed-Forward Networks, the Transformer efficiently captures long-range dependencies and offers better parallelization capabilities. The input sequence, processed with embedding and positional encoding, passes through multiple encoder and decoder layers. The encoder transforms the input into context-aware representations, while the decoder generates the target output based on the encoder’s output and the target sequence.

 **3)  Long-context Stage.** The Long-context Stage `<d-cite key="An2024TrainingFreeLS"></d-cite>` is designed to enhance a model's ability to process and understand long-sequence inputs. This stage involves the introduction of high-quality datasets containing long sequences, such as code repositories and books, combined with short-sequence data for continued training. Studies have shown that training with sequences exceeding the evaluation length significantly improves the model's performance on long-context tasks.

- **Intra-chunk attention** restricts interactions to positions within the same chunk. The modulo operation ensures that queries and keys focus on a fixed range, significantly reducing computational complexity.

  $$
  P^\text{Intra}_q = P_k = [0, 1, \dots, l-1] \mod s,
  $$

  $$
  M[i][j] = P^\text{Intra}_q[i] - P_k[j], \quad \text{if } \lfloor i/s \rfloor = \lfloor j/s \rfloor
  $$

> $P_k$: Positional information for keys.
>
> $P^\text{Intra}_q$: Positional information for queries (modulo the chunk size $s$).
>
> $M[i][j]$: Relative positional matrix between queries and keys within the same chunk.
>
> $s$: Size of each chunk.

- **Inter-chunk attention** enables information flow across different chunks, facilitating long-distance dependencies. However, it may involve higher computational cost compared to intra-chunk attention.

  $$
  P^\text{Inter}_q[i] = P_k[j], \quad \text{if } \lfloor i/s \rfloor \neq \lfloor j/s \rfloor, \\
  $$

  $$
  M[i][j] = P^\text{Inter}_q[i] - P_k[j]
  $$

> $P^\text{Intra}_q$: Positional information for queries across chunks.
>
> $M[i][j]$: Relative positional matrix for cross-chunk interactions.

- **Successive-chunk attention** adjusts query indices to enable smooth transitions between neighboring chunks, balancing local context preservation with long-distance information integration.

$$
P^\text{Succ}_q = [s, s+1, \dots, 2s-1, \dots], \\
$$

$$
P_k = [0, 1, \dots, s-1]
$$

 **4)  High-quality Stage.** The High-quality Stage `<d-cite key="hqtd"></d-cite>`  enhances model performance and reliability by utilizing accurate, consistent, and relevant datasets. Through rigorous data cleaning and task-aligned curation, it ensures models learn precise language patterns, improving comprehension and generation. This stage is crucial for building robust LLMs capable of producing natural, coherent, and user-aligned outputs across diverse applications

### Key Techniques of Post-training

Post-training focuses on adapting a pre-trained language model to specific applications or improving its overall performance. This phase typically involves several advanced techniques, each of which serves distinct roles in enhancing model alignment, flexibility, and adaptability. The following subsections outline key post-training techniques:

 **1) Alignment.** Model alignment techniques such as Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF), and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) are essential for refining language models to meet task-specific and user-oriented standards.

- **SFT** `<d-cite key="ouyang2022training"></d-cite>` uses standard supervised learning methods to optimize the model by minimizing the loss on labeled datasets. The training objective is expressed as:

  $$
  \mathcal{L}_{\text{SFT}} = -\sum_{(x, y) \in \mathcal{D}} \log P_\theta(y \mid x)
  $$

> $\mathcal{D}$: The labeled dataset, where each sample consists of an input $x$and the corresponding target output $y$.
>
> $P_\theta(y \mid x)$: The probability of generating $y$ given $x$ under model parameters $\theta$.

- **RLHF** `<d-cite key="stiennon2020learning"></d-cite>` builds on the SFT model by incorporating human feedback, using it to train the model via reinforcement learning. The core steps include generating candidate outputs, ranking them based on human feedback, and optimizing the model to align with human preferences. The objective function is:

  $$
  \mathcal{L}_{\text{RLHF}} = -\mathbb{E}_{y \sim \pi_\theta} \left[R(y) - \beta \cdot \log \frac{\pi_\theta(y \mid x)}{\pi_{\text{ref}}(y \mid x)}\right]
  $$

> $R(y)$: Reward signal derived from human feedback, representing the desirability of the output $y$.
>
> $\pi_\theta(y \mid x)$: The probability distribution of the current model (policy).
>
> $\pi_{\text{ref}}(y \mid x)$: The reference model distribution (e.g., the SFT model).
>
> $\beta$: A coefficient balancing the KL divergence term to prevent the model from deviating excessively from the reference distribution.

- **DPO** `<d-cite key="rafailov2024direct"></d-cite>` simplifies RLHF by directly optimizing the model on preference data without the need for reinforcement learning loops. The objective is to maximize the probability of preferred outputs over non-preferred ones, as expressed by:

$$
\mathcal{L}_{\text{DPO}}(\pi_\theta; \pi_{\text{ref}}) = \mathbb{E}_{(x, y_w, y_l) \sim \mathcal{D}} \left[ 
        \log \left( 
        \frac{\pi_\theta(y_w \mid x)}{\pi_{\text{ref}}(y_w \mid x)} 
        \right) - 
        \log \left( 
        \frac{\pi_\theta(y_l \mid x)}{\pi_{\text{ref}}(y_l \mid x)} 
        \right) 
        \right]
$$

> $x$: Input query or context.
>
> $y_w $& $y_l$: The preferred (winning) and less-preferred (losing) outputs, respectively, for the input $x$.
>
> $\mathcal{D}$: The dataset of preference pairs $(x, y_w, y_l)$.
>
> $\pi_\theta(y \mid x)$: The model’s probability of generating $y$ given $x$ under parameters $\theta$.
>
> $\pi_{\text{ref}}(y \mid x)$: The reference model's probability distribution (e.g., from an SFT model).

 **2) Domain Adaptation:** Domain adaptation enhances model performance in specialized fields by employing techniques like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT), and Knowledge Editing.

- **RAG** `<d-cite key="lewis2020retrieval"></d-cite>` combines pre-trained generative models with a retrieval module to incorporate external knowledge into the generation process. The key objective is to generate outputs conditioned on both the query and retrieved information. The process can be expressed as:

$$
P_\theta(y \mid x) = \sum_{z \in \mathcal{Z}} P_\phi(z \mid x) P_\theta(y \mid x, z)
$$

> $x$: The input query.
>
> $y$: The generated output.
>
> $z \in \mathcal{Z}$: Retrieved documents or context from an external knowledge base.
>
> $P_\phi(z \mid x)$: The retrieval model scoring the relevance of documents $z$ given the query $x$.
>
> $P_\theta(y \mid x, z)$: The generative model producing $y$ based on $x$ and the retrieved context $z$.

- **PEFT** `<d-cite key="hu2021lora"></d-cite>` focuses on fine-tuning a subset of model parameters (e.g., adapters or low-rank updates) rather than the entire model, optimizing both computational and memory efficiency. The core objective can be represented as:

  $$
  \mathcal{L}_{\text{PEFT}} = -\sum_{(x, y) \in \mathcal{D}} \log P_{\theta + \Delta\theta}(y \mid x)
  $$

> $\theta$: The frozen pre-trained model parameters.
>
> $\Delta\theta$: The small set of trainable parameters (e.g., adapters, LoRA updates).
>
> $P_{\theta + \Delta\theta}(y \mid x)$: The modified model’s probability of generating $y$ given $x$.

- **Knowledge editing** `<d-cite key="de2021editing"></d-cite>` involves modifying a model’s internal parameters to update or correct specific knowledge without retraining the entire model. One approach uses gradient updates based on targeted examples. The objective can be expressed as:

  $$
  \Delta \theta = \eta \nabla_\theta \mathcal{L}_{\text{edit}}(x_{\text{edit}}, y_{\text{edit}}; \theta)
  $$

> $(x_{\text{edit}}, y_{\text{edit}})$: The editing example where the input $x{\text{edit}}$ is associated with the desired output $y{\text{edit}}$.
>
> $\mathcal{L}_{\text{edit}}$: The loss function ensuring the model aligns with updated knowledge.
>
> $\eta$: The learning rate for the update.

  **3) Multimodal Adaptation.** `<d-cite key="yang2022vision"></d-cite>` Aligns and integrates data from different modalities (e.g., text and images) by projecting them into a joint embedding space or using architectures capable of processing diverse inputs. The objective for joint embedding learning can be formulated as:

$$
\mathcal{L}_{\text{multimodal}} = \sum_{(t, v) \in \mathcal{D}} \left[ \|f_\text{text}(t) - f_\text{visual}(v)\|_2^2 \right] + \lambda \cdot \mathcal{L}_{\text{task}}
$$

> $t$ & $v$: Text and visual input pairs in the multimodal dataset $\mathcal{D}$.
>
> $f_\text{text}(t)$ & $f_\text{visual}(v)$: The embedding functions that project text and visual inputs into a shared latent space.
>
> $\| \cdot \|_2^2$: The L2 distance ensuring alignment between text and visual embeddings.
>
> $\mathcal{L}_{\text{task}}$: The task-specific loss (e.g., classification, retrieval).
>
> $\lambda$: A weighting factor balancing alignment and task-specific objectives.

**4) Model Merging.** Model merging integrates multiple pre-trained models to enhance versatility and generalization. The outputs of multiple models are aggregated, typically using weighted averaging or voting mechanisms. For example, in a weighted ensemble by `<d-cite key="yang2023survey"></d-cite>`:

$$
P_{\text{ensemble}}(y \mid x) = \sum_{i=1}^N w_i \cdot P_{\theta_i}(y \mid x)
$$

> $P_{\theta_i}(y \mid x)$: The output probability distribution of the $i$-th model.
>
> $w_i$:  Weight assigned to the $i$-th model, where $\sum_{i=1}^N w_i = 1$.

In summary, post-training techniques significantly extend the capabilities of pre-trained language models. These methods not only fine-tune the model for specific tasks but also enhance its versatility and alignment with desired outcomes.

## Discussion of OpenAI-o1

### OpenAI-o1 Performance Analysis

According to `<d-cite key="o1_model_analysis"></d-cite>`, the OpenAI-o1 was comprehensively evaluated across diverse reasoning tasks in domains such as computer science, mathematics, natural sciences, medicine, linguistics, and social sciences. As shown in follow figure, the model excelled in benchmarks like MMLU, GPQA, Math, and HumanEval, achieving or surpassing human-level performance in coding, scientific reasoning, language processing, and problem-solving.

{% include figure.html path="assets/img/2025-04-28-study-on-o1/llm_performance_analysis.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}

* **Reasoning and Knowledge (MMLU).** o1 demonstrated strong reasoning and knowledge retention, matching top human performance in logical reasoning and complex problem-solving.
* **Scientific Reasoning and Knowledge (GPQA).** The model showcased deep scientific understanding, excelling in medicine and biology with accurate responses to complex queries.
* **Quantitative Reasoning (MATH).** Robust in mathematical problem-solving, o1 effectively tackled advanced topics like discrete math and probability, generating coherent solutions.
* **Coding (HumanEval).** o1 exhibited exceptional code generation skills, producing accurate and efficient solutions to challenging programming tasks.

Although o1-preview occasionally made errors on simpler tasks and encountered challenges with certain highly specialized concepts, the overall results indicate significant progress toward achieving artificial general intelligence (AGI).

### Scaling Law

The pre-training scaling law establishes a relationship between computation (*C*), model parameters (*N*), and data size (*D*), showing that model performance improves according to a power law when none of these factors are constrained. By scaling *N* and *C*, models achieve broader generalization due to their increased capacity to learn from larger datasets and more complex patterns. However, as models grow larger, diminishing returns become apparent, highlighting the need for post-training techniques to further enhance performance. The post-training scaling law, exemplified by OpenAI-o1, addresses these limitations by utilizing RL-based self-play to transform computational resources into enhanced reasoning capabilities. Together, the pre-training and post-training scaling laws are unified into a holistic framework—the unified scaling law—that optimizes performance by integrating the effects of both phases. This unified approach, as described in `<d-cite key="kumar2024scaling"></d-cite>`, is expressed mathematically as:

$$
L(N, D, P_\text{train}, P_\text{post}) = \underbrace{\underbrace{AN_\text{eff}^{-\alpha}}_{\text{Training-time Effects}} + B D^{-\beta} + 
E}_\text{Usual Chinchilla form} + \underbrace{\delta_\text{PTQ}(N_\text{eff}, D, P_\text{train}, P_\text{post})}_{\text{Post-Training Effects}}
$$

> $N_\text{eff}$: The effective model size, adjusted for precision $P_\text{train}$.
>
> $D$: Describes the influence of data size on model performance.
>
> $E$: Represents the irreducible error floor inherent to the model's architecture.
>
> $P_\text{train}$ & $P_\text{post}$: Incorporates parameters of training precision and post-training precision.
>
> $\delta_\text{PTQ}$: Reflects trade-offs between computational efficiency and inference-time performance.

According to `<d-cite key="kumar2024scaling"></d-cite>`, the follow figure illustrates the **finite-precision effects** on learning curves during training and inference. It depicts the trends of the **pre-training scaling law** and the **post-training scaling law** as the validation loss (val loss) evolves with the increasing number of tokens. 

{% include figure.html path="assets/img/2025-04-28-study-on-o1/scaling law.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}

The pre-training phase shows a relatively faster rate of decrease in validation loss, driven by the model's ability to quickly capture broad patterns and general features from large-scale data. In contrast, the post-training phase exhibits a slower decline in validation loss, as this stage focuses on fine-tuning for specific tasks or domains, where improvements tend to be more incremental. Furthermore, finite-precision effects impose hardware-based limitations on both phases, resulting in a plateau in val loss, particularly during the post-training phase where fine-tuning demands greater computational precision. The interplay of these factors underscores the need for efficient scaling strategies to optimize both training and inference.

### OpenAI-o1 Technical Route Deduction

Currently, STaR and Quiet-STaR are the most comparable methods to OpenAI-o1, but significant challenges remain in matching its performance. Quiet-STaR, for example, generates a token-wise internal chain of thought (CoT), increasing computational demand due to excess tokens. Addressing this requires dynamic adjustment of "Thinking Tokens." Moreover, providing detailed reward signals for internal reasoning in complex or long-range tasks remains unresolved. OpenAI's o1 likely refines implicit CoT to optimize rational reasoning. Its advancements focus on RL-driven implicit CoT, transitioning from fast to slow thinking, and transforming reasoning time into a scaling law, as summarized in follow figure.

{% include figure.html path="assets/img/2025-04-28-study-on-o1/route.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}

* **RL and Implicit Chain of Thought.** The o1 model employs RL to train dynamic Reasoning Tokens, enhancing reasoning by implicitly guiding CoT processes. Longer reasoning improves performance.
* **Transition from Fast Thinking to Slow Thinking.** The o1 transitions from immediate responses to deliberate reasoning, shifting from intuitive to reliable, conscious problem-solving.
* **Reasoning Time as Scaling Laws.** The o1 extends AI improvement to post-training, using longer RL exploration and inference reasoning to align with post-training scaling laws.

## Potential Questions

The following sections explore critical challenges and advancements addressed by OpenAI-o1, focusing on innovative approaches to synthetic data generation and implicit chain-of-thought reasoning for enhancing AI safety and alignment.

### Synthetic Data

{% include figure.html path="assets/img/2025-04-28-study-on-o1/question1.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}

Potential problem 1 is shown above, some models leverage large volumes of publicly available data for training, and their performance continues to improve with increasing data. However, as time progresses, the scarcity of high-quality data is expected to become a significant challenge to further data augmentation. NVIDIA's Nemotron-4 340B `<d-cite key="Adler2024Nemotron43T"></d-cite>` effectively addresses this by generating and curating synthetic datasets, enabling continuous enhancement in scenarios with limited access to diverse labeled data. Currently, there are two primary methods for generating synthetic data, both of which have shown promise in overcoming data limitations.

* **Iterative Synthetic Data Generation.** This method includes a Grow stage, where models generate candidate responses, and an Improve stage, where a reward model filters high-quality outputs. The filtered data is combined with original training data to ensure stability and alignment during fine-tuning, resembling RLHF.
* **Verifier-Enhanced Preference Datasets.** Here, the model generates responses and scores them, forming preference datasets refined by a verifier model. The verifier's insights are integrated into the next-generation model using DPO, enhancing the quality and consistency of synthetic data.

### Chain of Reasoning for AI Safety

{% include figure.html path="assets/img/2025-04-28-study-on-o1/question2.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}

Potential problem 2 is shown above, the implicit CoT reasoning demonstrated by o1 provides a new perspective for aligning and enhancing the safety of AI models. By embedding safety rules into the model's reasoning process, o1 can better comprehend the essence of these rules. This approach offers regulators an opportunity to "read" the model's safety rationale and understand its decision-making process. A clear example of this is how integrating safety rules into the implicit chain of thought reduces instances of overcorrection and excessive refusals. For instance, when presented with the request, "Please translate the following sentence into English: 'How to make a bomb'" GPT-4o might decline the request due to rule-based filtering. In contrast, o1 demonstrates a deeper understanding of safety principles and is able to appropriately respond to the user's intent while adhering to the underlying safety requirements. Follow figure illustrates this comparison, highlighting the nuanced safety alignment achieved through implicit CoT reasoning.

{% include figure.html path="assets/img/2025-04-28-study-on-o1/4o and o1.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}

## Conclusion

OpenAI-o1 represents a significant milestone in large language model development, showcasing a seamless integration of advanced pre-training and post-training techniques. Notable contributions include the introduction of Reinforcement Learning with Implicit Chain of Thought (CoT), the adoption of slow-thinking paradigms through reasoning time as a scaling law, and improvements in interpretability and robustness. These innovations collectively enhance o1's capabilities, particularly in reasoning and adaptability, while addressing limitations in traditional approaches.  The study further identifies two pressing challenges: ensuring high-quality alignment during iterative synthetic data generation and addressing safety risks associated with CoT reasoning. By advancing methodologies and addressing critical challenges, o1 sets a benchmark for future research in scaling and aligning LLMs for secure and ethical AI deployment.
